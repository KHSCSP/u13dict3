'''
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) connect 
many different types of devices that access the internet. 
An API specifies how software components should interact, 
and an understanding of this type of program is essential 
for development of web applications. You will look at how 
information is exchanged on the internet through API endpoints 
on a server that stores data.
